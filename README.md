# First Neural Network in Python Using Keeras
## Diabetes Data Set 
### Data Set Information:

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. ADAP is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices. It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

### Attribute Information:

1. Number of times pregnant 
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test 
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) 
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) 
7. Diabetes pedigree function 
8. Age (years) 
9.  Diabetes Variable (1 for yes OR 0 For NO )
